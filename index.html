<h1>Birth Chart</h1>
<p>
    A birth chart, also known as a natal chart, is an astrological chart that is calculated based on the exact time,
    date, and location of your birth. <br>
    This chart shows the positions of the planets and astrological houses in the sky <br>
    at the moment of your birth, and can provide detailed insights into your personality, <br>
    motivations, relationships, and more.
